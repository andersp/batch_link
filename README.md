batch_link
==========

Very simple python script for creating batch symbolic links.

I found myself with a directory full of photos but only wanted to share a subset
of them. I created this script so I could create symbolic links to the desired
range of files rather than needing to copy them and take up more drive space.
Eventually I would like to make this run as a web app with a gui that you can
run locally or on a server.
